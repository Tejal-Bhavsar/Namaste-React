- What is `NPM`?
 Ans. Our React app is dependant on many packages as it has diffrent functionalities,it helps publishing and 
 downloading packages,npm allows you to install a new package from the registry.Its basically default package manager
 for Node also.
 
● - What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
 Ans. Parcel/webpack is a bundler it is a tool that lets you compile JavaScript modules,
 also known as module bundler.Given a large number of files, it generates a single file 
 (or a few files) that run your app.It can perform many operations,helps you bundle your resources.

Parcel Features:
HMR (Hot Module Replacement) - parcel keeps track of file changes via file watcher algorithm and renders the changes in the files
File watcher algorithm - made with C++
Minification
Cleaning our code
DEV and production Build
Super fast building algorithm
Image optimization
Caching while development
Compresses
Compatible with older version of browser
HTTPS in dev
Port Number
Consistent hashing algorithm
Zero Configuration
Automatic code splitting
installation commands:
Install:
npm install -D parcel
-D is used for development and as a development dependency.

Parcel Commands :
For development build:
npx parcel <entry_point> 
For production build :
npx parcel build <entry_point> 

● - What is `.parcel-cache`
Ans. .parcel-cache is used by parcel(bundler) to reduce the building time. It stores information about
your project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze 
everything from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode.

● - What is `npx` ?
Ans. A package can be executable without installing the package. It is an npm package runner so if 
any packages aren’t already installed it will install them automatically.

● - What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`
Ans. devDependencies are modules which are only required during development, while dependencies are modules
which are also required at runtime.
Dependencies should contain library and framework in which your app is built on, needs to function effectively.
such as Vue, React, Angular, Express, JQuery and etc. DevDependencies should contain modules/packages a developer
needs during development. such as, parcel, webpack, vite, mocha. These packages are necessary only while you are
developing your project, not necessary on production. To save a dependency as a devDependency on installation
we need to do,
npm install --save-dev   for dev dependencies

● - What is Tree Shaking?
Ans. Tree shaking is a term commonly used within a JavaScript context to describe the removal of dead code.
We are using bundlers like webpack/parcels which will take care of removing the dead code when bundling multiple
Javascript files into single files. This process is important for production ready application to have minifies 
clean version. Parcel Tree shaking is supported for both static and dynamic import(), CommonJS and ES modules, 
and even across languages with CSS modules. Parcel also concatenates modules into a single scope when possible,
rather than wrapping each module in a separate function. This is called “scope hoisting”.

● - What is Hot Module Replacement?
Ans. Hot Module Replacement (HMR) improves the development experience by automatically updating modules in
the browser at runtime without needing a whole page refresh. This means that application state can be retained
as you change small things.
Note: Parcel's HMR implementation supports both JavaScript and CSS assets.

● - List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your
own words.
5 superpowers of Parcel:

HMR (Hot Module Replacement) - adds, or removes modules while an application is running, without a full reload.
File watcher algorithm - File Watchers monitor directories on the file system and perform specific actions 
when desired files appear.
Minification - Minification is the process of minimizing code and markup in your web pages and script files.
Image optimization
Caching while development


● - What is `.gitignore`? What should we add and not add into it?
 .gitignore is the file which keeps track for what needs to be tracked in the version control by pushing it to git.
 We should add all the auto generated file, folders to git ignore as it can be generated on the fly and hence
 no tracking is required.

● - What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
Ans. Package.json is the versioning file which keeps track of all the package installed in the project. 
package-lock.json is the file which locks the exact version of the packages getting used in the project.
 package.json 1.this file is mandatory for every project 2.It contains basic information about the project
 3.Application name/version/scripts
 package.lock.json - 1.This file is automatically generated for those operations where npm modifies either 
 the node_module tree or package-json. 2.It is generated after an npm install
 3.It allows future devs & automated systems to download the same dependencies as the project.
 4.it also allows to go back to the past version of the dependencies without actual ‘committing the 
 node_modules folder. 5.It records the same version of the installed packages which allows to reinstall them. Future installs wll be capable of building identical description tree.

● - Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
Ans. You should never modify package-lock.json file as it locks the exact compatible version getting used in
the project. Modifying this file might create unecessary conflicts between different transitive dependencies
in the project. Whenever we need to modify the version for any package, we should do it in package.json or by 
running npm install specific version command.

● - What is `node_modules` ? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
Ans. node_modules is the cache for the external modules that your project depend upon. It includes all the 
packages required for your project, and it generates on the fly when you build the project and hence,
should not be pushed to git and should be added to .gitignore.

● - What is the `dist` folder?
Ans. dist is the production-ready compiled and distributable version of your code. 
It gets generated when you build your project. This compiled code alone is sufficient to serve the application.

● - What is `browserlists`
A: Browserslist is a tool that allows specifying which browsers should be supported in your frontend app
by specifying "queries" in a config file. It's used by frameworks/libraries such as React, Angular and Vue, 
but it's not limited to them.
